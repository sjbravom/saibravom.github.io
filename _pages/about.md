**Hi and welcome to my website!**

------

I am a postdoctoral fellow at [ENAC](https://www.enac.fr/en) since November 2021. 

I hold a Master's degree in [Economics of Markets and Organizations](https://www.tse-fr.eu/master-emo-international-track) from the [Toulouse School of Economics](https://www.tse-fr.eu). 

I obtained a Ph.D. in Economics from the [University of Pau](https://tree.univ-pau.fr/fr/index.html) in association with the [Chair of the Economics of Gas](https://www.cerna.minesparis.psl.eu/Recherche/Chaire-Economie-europeenne-du-gaz-naturel/Presentation-and-publications/) in 2021. !
