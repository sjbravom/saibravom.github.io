<summary>Abstract: </summary>
*  This project explores the impact that technologically oriented lenders have on credit market information asymmetries. New to other studies in the literature, I focus on both adverse selection and moral hazard. The fintechs are better at screening, diminishing adverse selection, while traditional banks remain better at monitoring borrowers. The importance of moral hazard decreases the informational advantage coming from better screening and implies that the more technologically enabled player may not always have a market presence if it cannot properly discipline the borrower.

<summary>Abstract </summary>
This paper studies how the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which grants users control over data and mitigates concerns over sharing them, affects banks and fintechs in the mortgage market. Using a difference-in-differences strategy comparing counties along the California border, we establish that the CCPA significantly increases loan applications to fintechs relative to banks, raising fintechs' market share by 19%. Consistent with improved screening due to applicants' greater willingness to share data with fintechs, fintechs engage in more individualized pricing, deny more applications, and increase their use of non-traditional data. In turn, fintechs can offer significantly lower loan rates.
